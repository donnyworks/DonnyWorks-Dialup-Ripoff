# DonnyWorks™ Dial-Up Ripoff
[ACHIVEMENT UNLOCKED: Insomniac Programming]

Welcome to the GitHub repo for DonnyWorks™'s dial-up ripoff. There are several files and I shall instruct you on how to use them.

# ON HOW TO USE THEM

This project is based on PyTuner and a bunch of cobbled together PyAudio code.

How to use the "sender":

`send.py [filename] [seconds per byte]`

How to use the "reciever":

`recieve.py [seconds to listen for]`

General:

I used NumPy, SciPy, and of course, PyAudio. Anything else mentioned SHOULD come built-in, but I'm not sure.

# CONTRIBUTING

I will occasionally read pull requests, so if you can figure out how to iron out the random ________ bugs that I couldn't iron out [on stream](https://youtube.com/live/hlGMv0_CF2w) then please make a pull request.
